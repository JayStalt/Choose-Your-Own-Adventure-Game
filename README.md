# Give Me a Quest

For this project, I developed an interactive choose-your-own-adventure game using a custom game engine built with HTML5 and Web Canvas. The game immerses players in a fantasy narrative where they choose a quest and navigate through a series of choices that shape their journey. Featuring dynamic loading screens with animated GIFs, the game provides a visually engaging experience as players progress through the story. The narrative branches into over 8 different custom endings, offering a variety of unique story paths and outcomes based on the player's decisions. Custom animations and graphics enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the game, showcasing my skills in game design, storytelling, and technical implementation within a web-based environment.
